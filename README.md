Researchers and other experts suspects that the growth of the UPOV has not resulted in larger crop yields over time and would like to test their hypothesis by analyzing publicly 
available data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. This dataset records hectares of land area harvested and tons of output produced for different 
primary crops (e.g., almonds, papayas, avocadoes) each year from 1961 to 2021 for over 200 countries. It is also supplemented by additional datasets listing standardized country codes, 
units of measurement, and quality control flags and countries' membership in UPOV over time.

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) could explore the following questions:

How are crop types currently distributed across countries, and how has this changed over time, if at all?
For each crop type, has there been an overall increase or decrease in the number of tons produced? In the area harvested? Are there certain countries where production or land area of the crop has dramatically increased or decreased? Explain.
For each country, how has the total area harvested and tons of crops produced changed over time? Cross-reference these time series with current events to better understand why this might be the case.
How are the quality flags (official figure, estimate value, imputed value, etc.) distributed across the dataset? Is data collected for certain years or geographic areas seemingly more robust?
Meanwhile, our main research questions are as follows:

Is membership in UPOV positively correlated with, or predictive of, higher crop yields? Is the effect noticeable after a certain amount of time has passed since joining?
What effect does joining UPOV have on the area harvested of specific crops? Are there crops that seem to have been more affected? If so, conduct a case study of one to two crops to better understand what factors may have contributed to that outcome.
Expected Deliverables
Each team is expected to turn in:

A Python script with functions to clean and standardize the crop dataset.
An EDA that loads the data and then answers the questions above using one or more Jupyter notebooks.
A Jupyter notebook that explores the correlation between UPOV membership and crop yields and determines the extent to which UPOV membership is predictive of yields.
A Jupyter notebook that explores the effect joining UPOV had on the area harvested for different crops.
A written (2-3 pages) or digital report that walks through your data, methodology, analysis, and conclusions and provides data visualizations.
